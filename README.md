## [10 reasons why you should place comments in your code](https://razmans.medium.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-place-comments-in-your-code-96783a69ceda)

### What I Found Interesting
I found it very interesting and personable how the article is all about commmenting and the specific reasons for why commenting your code is necessary. I feel that often many of us think that commenting our code is not necessary. This article really hits home in that sense, and definitely encourages me to be much more conscious to comment my code, not even for my own sake but for potential collaborators.

I agree a lot about what the article explains about the importance of commenting code. I built a habit of it as much as I could when collaborating, which always seems to be really helpful to others. But even so, I notice lack of comments on personal projects or assignments and can get confused by what I myself wrote a couple weeks, or even days ago if I don't have comments. It's also always been extremely helpful when professors comment starter code on assignments, which has really sped up work for me in the past. Overall this article also really hit close to home, and developers should always try to comment/write readable code.
